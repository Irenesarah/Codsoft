As part of the Codsoft virtual internship,I am sharing all the tasks that has been allocated to me

Task 1
TITANIC SURVIVAL PREDICTION
Dataset:https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/brendan45774/test-file
Predicting the titanic survival is a classic machine learning problem.Here I have employed Random Forest classifier to likelihood of survival for passengers aboard the Titanic. Random Forest is a powerful ensemble learning technique that combines the predictive power of multiple decision trees, making it well-suited for this classification task.The analysis begins by collecting and preprocessing passenger data, including information such as age, gender, ticket class, and family size. We explore the dataset, handle missing values, and encode categorical features. After splitting the data into training and testing sets, we train a Random Forest classifier on the training data.In conclusion, this study showcases the application of machine learning, specifically the Random Forest algorithm, for predicting Titanic survival. By making use of passenger data and advanced modeling techniques, we can gain a deeper understanding of the factors that determined who survived the disaster, shedding light on this enduring historical event.

Task 2
MOVIE RATING PREDICTION WITH PYTHON
Dataset:https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adrianmcmahon/imdb-india-movies
Movie rating prediction is a fundamental challenge in the field of data analytics and recommendation systems. This study explores the application of linear regression models to predict movie ratings based on various features. Linear regression is a well-established statistical technique that can be utilized to uncover relationships between independent variables (such as year,votes,duration,genre,director,Actor1) and the dependent variable (movie rating).we first compile a comprehensive dataset that includes information about movies, including their genre, director, cast, budget,year,votes. We preprocess the data by encoding categorical variables and handling missing values. We then split the data into training and testing sets to train and evaluate the linear regression model.To evaluate the model's performance, we employ metrics like mean squared error (MSE) and R-squared (RÂ²) to quantify the quality of predictions. Cross-validation is also utilized to assess the model's generalization capabilities.In conclusion, this study showcases the utility of linear regression as a tool for predicting movie ratings. By using a diverse set of movie features, it offers a data-driven approach to understanding and optimizing movie success in a competitive and dynamic industry.

Task 3
IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION
Dataset:https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arshid/iris-flower-dataset
This problem focuses on using Support Vector Machines (SVM), a powerful classification algorithm, and random forest classifier to predict the species of iris flowers based on their features. The Iris dataset, which contains measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width for three different species of iris flowers, is utilized for this purpose.Started by exploring the Iris dataset, performing data preprocessing tasks such as data cleaning and feature scaling. The dataset is then divided into a training set and a testing set to train and evaluate the SVM model.In conclusion, this study showcases the application of SVM in solving the iris flower classification problem. By leveraging the SVM model, we gain a deeper understanding of its capabilities in distinguishing between iris species and its potential for broader applications in botanical and ecological research.

Task 4
SALES PREDICTION USING PYTHON
Dataset:https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yashpaloswal/ann-car-sales-price-prediction
This problem focuses on using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), a powerful machine learning technique, to predict car sales based on various factors such as price, brand, model, features, and market conditions.This begins by assembling a comprehensive dataset containing historical car sales data and related features. Data preprocessing is carried out, including data cleaning, normalization, and encoding of categorical variables. The dataset is then divided into a training set and a testing set for model training and evaluation.The results of this research illustrate the effectiveness of ANN in predicting car sales, offering valuable insights into the factors that impact the automotive market. By understanding the relationship between various features and car sales, dealerships and manufacturers can make informed decisions regarding pricing, marketing, and inventory management.In conclusion, this study highlights the potential of ANN models in car sales prediction. By the capabilities of artificial neural networks, we gain a data-driven approach to improving sales forecasting in the competitive and dynamic automotive industry.

Task 5:
CREDIT CARD FRAUD DETECTION
Dataset:https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud
Credit card fraud remains a significant concern for financial institutions and cardholders worldwide. In response to this challenge, this problem explores the application of logistic regression, a widely used statistical method, for the purpose of detecting fraudulent credit card transactions.This problem begins by compiling a dataset of credit card transactions, including information such as transaction amount, time of transaction, and various other features. Data preprocessing is conducted, encompassing tasks like data cleaning, outlier detection, and feature scaling. The dataset is then divided into a training set and a testing set for the logistic regression model's training and evaluation.This study showcases the utility of logistic regression as an effective method for credit card fraud detection. By applying this approach, we contribute to improving the security and trustworthiness of electronic payment systems, ultimately safeguarding the financial interests of both cardholders and financial institutions.
